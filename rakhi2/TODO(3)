Mood Tracking Achievements:

Consistent Tracker: Log moods for 7 consecutive days.
Monthly Mood Tracker: Log at least 20 moods in a single month.
Year-long Journey: Log at least one mood per week for a year.
Journal Entries Achievements:

Daily Journaling: Write a journal entry every day for a week.
Reflective Thinker: Write 50 journal entries.
Memory Keeper: Write 100 journal entries.
Rewards and Unlocking System:

First Step: Upload at least one mood entry to unlock the first reward.
Explorer: Use all major features of the app (mood tracking, journaling, reminders, etc.) to unlock an achievement.
Completionist: Unlock all other achievements to receive a special reward.
