1)re-call the plan .. original plan of rakhi app development... what we had covered and what we need to
2) as in settings that is reminder.. how about rename it to reminder and make another script of settings with really a functions worth name settings..
3)in historic data_screen .. it uses a graph.. which is okay.. but.. the way of representation is not good.. improve it...
maybe.. improve those points and x and y axis..
4) in habit tracker.. what is it's purporse... why even track it.. in historic data.. 
make the habit tracer side.. purely functional... 

5) ...
# models.py
any improvement in this???
